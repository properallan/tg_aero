\section{INTRODUCTION}

These instructions are intended to serve as a guide for the formatting of papers to be published in the Proceedings. The proceedings of the 27$^\mathrm{th}$ COBEM will be published in Adobe\textsuperscript{TM} PDF format.

Papers MUST be formatted according to these instructions. This file can be used as a template for LaTeX. LaTeX is available as free software. It can also be used as a formatting guide for users of other word processing programs.

Submissions are limited to a minimum of 6 pages and a maximum of 10 pages, including tables and figures. 

\section{TEXT FORMAT}

Manuscripts should be in English, typewritten on A4 pages in Times New Roman font, size 10, except for the title, author affiliation, abstract, and keywords, for which special formatting instructions are given above. Use single space between lines throughout the text.

The block of text containing the title, author names and affiliations, abstract, and keywords must be indented 0.1 cm from the left margin and marked by a $2\ 1/4$ pt wide black line on the far left.

Pages must have a top margin of 3 cm and all other margins (left, right, and bottom) must have 2 cm. The text must be justified. The first line of each paragraph must be indented by 0.5 cm. Sufficient information must be given directly in the text or by reference to available published work. Footnotes should be avoided.

{\color{red} PAGES {\bf SHOULD NOT} BE NUMBERED.}
 
All symbols and notations must be defined in the text. Physical quantities must be expressed in the SI (metric) units. Mathematical symbols that appear in the text must be written in italics. Units should not be italicized (e.g., kg, m, MJ, kW/m$^2$, \dots, instead of $kg$, $m$, $MJ$, $kW / m^2$, \dots). 

Bibliographic references should be cited in the text by giving the last name of the author(s) and the year of publication, according to the following examples: ``Recent work~\citep{Simas2019}\dots'' or ``Recently, \citet{Simas2019}\dots''. In the case of three or more authors, the form ``\citep{Caraguay2022}'' should be used. Two or more references having the same authors and publication year must be distinguished by appending ``a'', ``b'', etc., to the year of publication. For example: ``In the works of~\citet{Santos2013a} and \citet{Santos2013b}, \dots''.

Acceptable references include journal articles~\citep{Caraguay2022}, articles published in conference proceedings~\citep{Santos2013a}~\citep{Santos2013b}~\citep{Nostrani2019}, conference proceedings~\citep{Carvalho2018}, books~\citep{MendoncaFancello2019}~, Master's Theses~\citep{Spillere2022} and Doctoral Dissertations or Doctoral Theses~\citep{Santos2020}, patents~\citep{Binder2016}~\citep{Fernandes2018}, reports, when publicly available,~\citep{EPE2022}, websites and specific pages in websites ~\citep{MLA20}, and submitted articles (if the journal is indicated).

References should be listed at the end of the manuscript according to instructions provided in Section~\ref{Sec:references}.

\subsection{Section titles and subtitles}

Section headings and subheadings must be left-aligned and bolded in Times New Roman, size 10. They must be numbered with Arabic numerals separated by periods. No more than 3 subheadings (\emph{section}, \emph{subsection}, and \emph{subsubsection}) should be used. 

There must be a single line above and below each section title/subtitle.

\subsection{Mathematical equations}

Mathematical equations must be indented 0.5 cm from the left margin. They must be written in Times New Roman (or Cambria Math), italics, font size 10 pt. Arabic numerals must be used as equation numbers, enclosed in parentheses and right justified, as shown in the example below. Equations should be designated as either ``Eq.~(\ref{Eq:1})'' in the middle of a sentence or ``Equation~(\ref{Eq:1})'' at the beginning of a sentence. Matrix and vector quantities can be indicated either by square and curly brackets, as in Eq.~(\ref{Eq:1}), or by boldface, as in Eq.~(\ref{Eq:2}). A blank line must be inserted above and below each equation. The symbols used in the equations must be defined immediately before or after their first occurrence.
â€œThe equation of the dynamical system is written in one of the two forms,
\begin{equation}
[M]\{\ddot{x}\}+[C]\{\dot{x}(t)\}+[K]\{x(t)\}={f(t)},
\label{Eq:1}
\end{equation}
or,
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{M}\ \ddot{\mathbf{x}}(t)+\mathbf{C}\ \dot{\mathbf{x}}(t)+\mathbf{K}\ \mathbf{x}(t)=\mathbf{f}(t), 
\label{Eq:2}
\end{equation}
where $[M]$ or $\mathbf{M}$, $[C]$ or $\mathbf{C}$, and $[K]$ or $\mathbf{K}$ are the mass, dissipation and stiffness matrices, respectively, and $[\ddot{x}]$ or $\ddot{\mathbf{x}}$, $[\dot{x}]$ or $\dot{\mathbf{x}}$, $[x]$ or $\mathbf{x}$, and $[f]$ or $\mathbf{f}$ are the acceleration, velocity, displacement, and input force vectors, respectively.''

\subsection{Figures and tables}

Figures and tables should be placed as close as possible to the place in the text where they are first mentioned and must be numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals. Figures must be mentioned either as ``Fig.~\ref{Fig:1}'' in the middle of a sentence or as ``Figure~\ref{Fig:1}'' at the beginning of a sentence.

Figures and tables should be placed in the text as close as possible to the point they are first mentioned and must be numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals. Figures must be referred to either as ``Fig.~\ref{Fig:1}'' in the middle of a phrase or as ``Figure~\ref{Fig:1}'' in the beginning of a sentence. 

Both the figures and their captions must be centered in width. Figure captions should be centered and no longer than 3 lines. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[angle=0, width=17cm]{figure.jpeg}
\caption{Non-dimensional temperature contour $\hat{T}$ at the flame front at $t/\tau_f = 60$. }
\label{Fig:1}
\end{figure}

A vertical space equivalent to a blank line must be inserted before and after each figure.

The legend for the data symbols as well as the labels for each curve should be included into the figure. Lettering should be large enough for ease reading. All units must be expressed in the S.I. (metric) system.

Color figures and high-quality photographs can be included in the manuscript. To reduce the file size and preserve the graphic resolution, figures must be saved into GIF (figures with less than 16 colors) or JPEG (for higher color density) files before being inserted in the manuscript.

Tables must be designated as either ``Tab.~\ref{Tab:1}'' in the middle of a sentence or ``Table~\ref{Tab:1}'' at the beginning of a sentence. Both the tables themselves and their titles must be centered in width. Table titles should be no longer than 3 lines. The font and size used in the tables must be similar to that used in the body of the text (both in size and style). Units must be given in the S.I. (metric) system. Any explanations should be at the foot of the tables, not in the tables themselves.

A vertical space equivalent to a blank line must be inserted before and after each table. The design of the table margins is up to you. An example can be found in Tab.~\ref{Tab:1}.
