abstract = {Supercritical fluids represent an active field of research, interesting from the theoretical point of view, and for industrial applications. We describe a numerical method for the simulation of supercritical fluid flow phenomena, valid for a general real gas equation of state. Three state equations (van der Waals, Carnahan-Starling-De Santis, Redlich-Kwong), describing the thermodynamic behavior of a gas near its critical point are implemented. Numerical tests in the case of the flow through a nozzle and the shock tube problem, show the reliability of the numerical scheme. The response of a supercritical fluid confined into a slab with closed ends, initially at rest in thermodynamic equilibrium, when one boundary is heated, termed Piston effect, is also investigated.}

    abstract = "{This paper proposes the use of a Grid Convergence Index (GCI) for the uniform reporting of grid refinement studies in Computational Fluid Dynamics. The method provides an objective asymptotic approach to quantification of uncertainty of grid convergence. The basic idea is to approximately relate the results from any grid refinement test to the expected results from a grid doubling using a second-order method. The GCI is based upon a grid refinement error estimator derived from the theory of generalized Richardson Extrapolation. It is recommended for use whether or not Richardson Extrapolation is actually used to improve the accuracy, and in some cases even if the conditions for the theory do not strictly hold. A different form of the GCI applies to reporting coarse grid solutions when the GCI is evaluated from a “nearby” problem. The simple formulas may be applied a posteriori by editors and reviewers, even if authors are reluctant to do so.}",
